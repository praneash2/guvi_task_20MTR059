Inorder to run copy this folder and paste it in the xampp/htdocs and make sure to install all the dependencies
#IMPORTANT NOTE: 
    #Paste this folder(guvi_task_20MTR059) inside XAMPP htdocs folder then start the apache server to run these scripts.
    #Also in the profile.php the redis function is commented because it might give error if the redis.service is not running in baground so inorder for not to disrupt the other fuction i made the commented if needed first start the redis.service.exe then uncomment that and run.

UPDATE:
As ive used the phpAdmin.co for the Sql databse.Due to some issues my account is not working in that website if you want to run the website kindly change the database to local host in the register.php and login.php and make the table with colums id,username,password .
sorry for the inconvenience.
